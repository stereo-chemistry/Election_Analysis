# Analysis of Election Results with Python in VS Code
## Overview of Project
This project is an analysis of election results across 3 different counties and 3 different candidates. The analysis is coded in Python language in VS Code. The csv file of raw data contains 3 columns and 369,712 rows of data. The analysis is conducted with several different variables, lists and dictionaries. For loops and if statements are used to solve for these objects and host their calculations.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to generate a working Python script in VS Code that can form election results from a csv file of the election data. Additionally, the purpose of this project is to provide an easy to read output in the form of a text file to communicate these results to any reader. The goal for the Python script is to run through any election data csv file and give output of total votes, votes and percentage of total votes per county, report the county with greatest voter turnout, report each candidate with their percentage of total votes and votes received, report the winning candidate with their vote count and percentage of total votes received.
